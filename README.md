Hello, and welcome to your first cloned Repository. 
You must be pretty smart to have made it this far. 
In this Forked repository are a series of tasks you'll have to finish before you head out of class today. 
They are outlined BELOW:

Must Do's
    Quick Warmup
    Command Line Practice Exercises
    X Marks the Spot Game

Quick Warmup
1 - Use mkdir test to create a directory called test
2 - Use cd test to go into the newly create directory
3 - Use touch test.txt to create a new file called test.txt
4 - USe cd .. to go back into your previous directory 

Now you're ready! 

Command Line Practice Exercises - In the file tree to the left, are a list of directories (folders) and files. Use only Terminal commands and command statements to do the following:

1 - Use the pwd command to make sure you're in the "workspace" directory.
2 - Use the ls command to see all the files and directories 
3 - Use rm -r removeMe.txt command statement to remove the removeMe.txt file
4 - Use rm -r removeThisFolder command statement to remove the removeThisFolder directory
5 - Remove the removeMeToo.txt file
6 - Use mv renameMe newName command statement to change the name of the renameMe directory
7 - Use mv changeMyName.txt changed.txt command statement to change the name of the changeMyName.txt file
8 - Use mv movethis.txt newName/ to move the movethis.txt file into the newName directory
9 - Use touch path.txt to create a text file named path file
10 - Ok you can use your mouse for only this one though, open the path.txt file you just created by double clicking. 

Whew, I feel the heat from that keyboard. Take a couple seconds, collect your thoughts because you made it here.
Next up, X marks the spot game!

X marks the spot - Locate the findthex directory to your left again. 

1 - Inside thefindthex directory are a series of files and other directories. 
2 - Your task is to locate ONLY the x.txt files. 
3 - Using cd (change directory) or cd .. (go back a previous directory) navigate through until you've found ALL 5 x.txt files. 
4 - Use the ls command to see which files are in the directory. 
5 - When you have found one, use pwd to print the file path of the where the x.txt file resides. 
6 - Then copy and paste the file path into the path.tx file.
